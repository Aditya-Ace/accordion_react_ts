import React from 'react'
import { motion } from 'framer-motion'

// 2. Types and interfaces
interface ComponentProps {
// ...
}

// 3. Component implementation
export const Component: React.FC<ComponentProps> = ({
// props
}) => {
// hooks and state
// event handlers
// render logic
}
\`\`\`

### Accessibility Requirements
